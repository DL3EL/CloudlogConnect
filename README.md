Idea taken from CloudlogBashCat, a simple script to keep Cloudlog in synch with fldigi or sparksdr
This script should be startet @reboot, it waits until SparkSDR or FLDigi is available and pushes the data (frequency and mode) to Cloudlog
There is no need to use FLRig or any other special services on the target machine. If you use FLDigi and find it useful, look at FLDigi_log to get your FLDIgi qso automatiscally pushed to Cloudlog.

All parameters are explained in the .conf file

Script is outdated, for FLDigi use FLDigi_Log and for SparkSDR use SparkSDR_Log. Same features, plus logging.
